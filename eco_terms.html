    <h1>ECO USER TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the "Agreement"), constitute a binding legal contract between you and Eco, Inc., located at 2261 Market Street #4348, San Francisco, CA 94114 (&ldquo;Eco&rdquo;) and govern your use of Eco's products, services and other technologies or functionalities, whether provided through Eco's website located at www.eco.com, associated websites, or any desktop or mobile applications developed by Eco (collectively, the &ldquo;Eco Technology&rdquo;).</p> <p>We may need to update these Terms from time to time. We'll notify you if that happens.
  <br/>
  <p>
    For purposes of this Agreement, "you" shall mean you as an individual user of the Eco Services (as defined in Section 2) and any other person you have authorized to access your Eco account, or for whom you have otherwise directly or indirectly facilitated such access.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      AGREE TO ACCEPT. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. In order to access and use the Eco Services, you are required to indicate acceptance of this Agreement by clicking the &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo; Button below (&ldquo;Acceptance&rdquo;) and provide all information required by Eco for applicable registration and compliance (&ldquo;Registration Information&rdquo;). By clicking "I Accept," registering for an account, downloading an Eco mobile application, accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Eco Services or Eco Technology, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions herein, including the Eco Privacy Policy, any applicable end user license agreement, and any additional terms or future modifications. If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in this Agreement, you may not access or use any of the Eco Services.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
      ECO SERVICES AND REGISTRATION.
      <ol>
        <br/>
        <li> Eco allows you to buy, receive, hold and transfer funds in virtual currency in accordance with the terms herein (the &ldquo;Eco Services&rdquo;). The role of Eco in all cases is that of an independent contractor. You shall have no authority to act on behalf of Eco or to bind it, and in no event will your relationship with Eco be construed to be that of partners, employer employee, or agents of each other, unless explicitly stated herein.</li>
        <br/>
        <li> To access most features of the Eco Services you must register for an Eco account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself (such as your email address, address, date of birth or other contact information, and in some cases information regarding a linked bank account). You agree that the information you provide to us is and will be accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you may be asked to provide a username and password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and password. You also agree to use reasonable efforts to utilize one or more of the following multi-factor authentication methods in order to provide further security to your account: (i) phone number, (ii) email address, or (iii) such other method as may be offered by Eco in its sole discretion. If you are accessing your Eco account from a new device (or if you are logging in to your Eco account for the first time), you may be required to log in using your email, username or password, then complete a multi-factor authentication process. Once you confirm your identity via the multi-factor authentication process, you will have full access to your Eco account. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur within and pursuant to your account. By using the Eco Services, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us, for example by email or SMS, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</li>
        <br/>
        <li> You can load funds into your Eco account from a valid bank account via ACH transfer or wire transfer. You can also withdraw funds from your Eco account into your linked bank account via ACH transfer. Your balance may be in a pending state and may not be credited to your Eco account (in the case of a deposit) or arrive in your bank account (in the case of a withdrawal) until after the bank transfer has cleared, usually within 5 business days. We may debit your linked bank account as soon as you initiate a deposit. The name on your linked bank account and your wire transfer must match the name verified on your Eco account.</li>
        <br/>
        <li> You may initiate recurring deposits into your Eco account, in which case you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected amount, such as recurring automated clearing house (ACH) debit or credit entries from or to your linked bank account, or direct deposits from your payroll provider. Your recurring transactions will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Eco cancels the recurring order. If you select a U.S. bank account as your payment method for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday, or after bank business hours, the ACH credit or debit will be executed on the next business day. If your bank is unable to process any electronic ACH debit entry, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of cancellation of the transaction and notify you of your options to try again or otherwise work with your bank. This authorization will remain in full force and effect until you change your recurring transaction settings in the Eco App (as defined below), or until you provide us written notification at support@eco.com. Eco may, at any time, terminate recurring transactions by providing notice to you.</li>
        <br/>
        <li> You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful for any reason, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Eco, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Crypto Wallet (as defined below) balance or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF), or similar fees charged by your payment provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any fund transfers in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we reasonably suspect that the transaction is erroneous; or if we suspect the transaction violates Section 5 as set forth below. In such instances, Eco will reverse the transaction.</li>
        <br/>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      CRYPTO WALLET.  Utilizing the mobile Eco application (the &ldquo;Eco App&rdquo;), you may purchase cryptocurrency which shall be deposited into a wallet application (&ldquo;Crypto Wallet&rdquo;).   You agree that your interaction with the Crypto Wallet, and any funds held therein, shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of that Eco partner or partners which custody your funds and otherwise facilitate the use of such funds (each, a &ldquo;Wallet Provider&rdquo;). Once funds have been successfully deposited into the Crypto Wallet, Eco shall bear no further liability for such funds or for any activity related to the funds which occurs thereafter.
    </li>
    <li>
      USER INCENTIVES, INTEREST AND BONUSES.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Eco may make available to you from time to time through the Eco Services offers on certain third-party products and services (each an "Offer"). Each Offer may be subject to Additional Terms and may be discontinued by Eco at any time without notice. At any time and in Eco's sole discretion, Eco may: (i) determine whether or not you are eligible to redeem an Offer; (ii) determine whether or not you have earned any rewards related to such Offer; or (iii) adjust your rewards total to accurately and fairly reflect the rewards that you have actually earned. Eco may, in its sole discretion, deduct from your Eco account any rewards that Eco determines you have not earned or you have earned in violation of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          From time to time, Eco may introduce special bonuses or incentives that may be available to you in connection with the Eco Services ("Bonuses"). Such Bonuses may include, for example, a referral bonus or incentive to refer others to Eco ("Referral Bonus"). Qualifying referrals apply only to new users who register with Eco, download the Eco App and connect it to their direct deposit, and receive their first deposit into the Eco App. You will receive credit for a referral only upon the satisfaction of each of those conditions. You represent and warrant that you will only refer Eco to those individuals whom you know personally. You will not be eligible to earn Referral Bonuses if you invite other users who share the same mobile device, or who are already registered Eco users or have already been referred, or if you publish your personal referral code on a public website, store, or forum for the purposes of referring people who you do not know personally. Such actions violate this Agreement and shall be grounds for Eco to terminate your account, rescind any Referral Bonuses, or take other actions as appropriate. Where you cannot produce examples of how you made referrals, including screenshots of where you made referrals, Eco reserves the right to decline to award you Referral Bonuses, rescind Bonuses, or take other remedial actions. Bonuses will be paid to you through the Eco App within 30 days of the satisfaction of the applicable referral terms. Your Eco account must remain active and in good standing, as determined by Eco in its sole discretion, to receive Bonuses. Bonus offerings are limited time offers and Eco reserves the right to modify the terms ofm, suspend or end any Bonus offering at any time its sole discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eco may from time to time offer interest rate return on your balance held in the Eco App, quoted as an annual percentage rate. If you consent to receive interest return by depositing in the Eco App, your funds may be pooled with other user funds and lent through third party partners to generate interest. Your interest rate may change from time to time at the discretion of Eco or its partners. By depositing funds in the Eco App, you are expressly consenting to and accepting the applicable rate of interest then displayed in the Eco App, notwithstanding the interest rates posted or advertised elsewhere by our partners. If the posted interest rate changes, you will be deemed to have accepted such change unless and until you transfer your balance out of the Eco App. Where you do not wish to accept the posted rate of interest, your sole recourse is to transfer any digital currency out of the Eco App. Interest will be credited to your balance within the first three business days of each calendar month for interest accrued during the preceding calendar month. Once credited, interest is immediately available to you. You are responsible for reporting all interest earned on your Eco balance to the proper taxing authorities and for the payment of all taxes and any other amounts due thereon. Any hosted balances maintained by our partners including, without limitation, interest-bearing balances are not bank accounts or deposit accounts under traditional banking laws.

      <ol>
        <li>
You will take reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of the authorization procedures and the user IDs and passwords provided by Eco with regard to the Eco Services and/or the Eco Technology. If you believe or suspect that any such user IDs and passwords have been known or accessed by unauthorized persons, you will immediately notify Eco in a manner affording Eco a reasonable opportunity to act on the information. You acknowledge that failure to immediately notify Eco could result in loss of funds and unauthorized access to confidential information, including your linked bank account(s). Eco reserves the right to prevent access to the Eco Services should Eco have reason to believe the confidentiality of the security procedure or the confidentiality of the user IDs and passwords have been compromised. You are solely responsible for your actions, and those of any person authorized by you to use your user ID and password, and for any transactions resulting from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your account.
        </li>

        <li>
          RISK OF INSTRUCTIONS.  You are solely responsible to ensure that all information and instructions provided to Eco are correct and complete.  Eco will not be liable for any transactions which have been conducted in accordance with instructions provided by you, regardless of whether such instructions include incorrect, incomplete, limited or no identifying information related to a transfer.

Eco WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT INSTRUCTIONS ARE EXECUTED IN A TIMELY MANNER BUT Eco MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO COMPLETE FIAT OR DIGITAL CURRENCY PROCESSING BECAUSE THE Eco SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

THIS PARAGRAPH GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.
