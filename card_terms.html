        unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given

        you are responsible for that person’s transactions with your Card, and
        if you have given your Card information to a merchant for a transaction,

        we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Eco
        Card, without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much

        Also, if you become aware of and/or your periodic statement shows

        you do not notify Eco within sixty (60) days after you become aware of
        the transaction and/or after the statement was made available to you,
        you may not get back any value you lost after the sixty (60) days if Eco
        can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the value if
        you had notified Eco in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or
        hospital stay) kept you from telling us, Eco may extend the time
        periods. If the Card has been lost or stolen, the Card will be blocked
        to keep losses down.
