<p class="p2"><b>7. Authorized Users</b></p>
<p class="p2">You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of your Eco Card(s). If you permit another person to have access to a Card or Card number, this will be treated as if you authorized such use and you will be liable for all transactions and fees incurred by those persons. You are wholly responsible for the use of each Card according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="p15"><b>B. Payment Authorizations for Overages</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>1. Your Electronic Funds Transfer and ACH Debit Authorization for Overages</b></p>
<p class="p2">When you use the Eco Card Services you authorize the Issuer to immediately debit your Eco Account by the amount of any transactions made using an Eco Card including any applicable fees. In the event that your Eco Account does not have a sufficient balance to cover all transactions made using an Eco Card, you authorize us to complete a transaction from any funding source linked to your Eco Account (an “<b>Alternate Funding Account</b>”) in the amount necessary to cover the difference between your Eco Card transactions and your Eco Account balance (the “<b>Overage Amount</b>”). Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until you close a Card or your Eco Account is closed or terminated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any attempt by you to revoke this authorization will result in your inability to use the Eco Card Services.</p>
<p class="p2">If you provide us with the ACH routing and account information for your Alternate Funding Account, you authorize Eco and our partner bank to initiate electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House ("<b>ACH</b>") of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association ("<b>NACHA</b>")) from your Alternate Funding Account up to the Overage Amount. You agree that ACH transactions you authorize comply with all applicable laws.</p>
<p class="p2">For all other payment methods used as Alternate Funding Accounts, such as debit card funding, you authorize Eco to transmit payment details to a bank acting under Eco’s instructions to charge your Alternate Funding Account up to the Overage Amount. You agree to maintain funds in the specified Funding Account that are sufficient to cover all of your activities with the Eco Card Services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">You indemnify and hold us and our partner banks harmless from any claims by any other owner of the account. You are responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information you provide about each payment.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>2. Inability to Access Funds from your Eco Account</b></p>
<p class="p2">If we are unable to access funds from your Eco Account to complete a transaction that you request for any reason (for example, if there are insufficient funds or credit available in your Eco Account to cover the requested transaction), the transaction may not be completed. In such case, you agree:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8">You will reimburse Eco immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Eco sent a payment to the Payee on your behalf;</li>
  <li class="li9">You will reimburse Eco for any fees imposed on us as a result of the failed transaction; and</li>
  <li class="li9">You will reimburse us for any fees we incur in attempting to collect the amount of the failed transaction from you.</li>
  <li class="li8">We are not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><b>C. Our Rights Regarding the Services</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>1. Modifications to this Agreement</b></p>
<p class="p2">You agree that Eco and the Issuer may modify this agreement, or any other Eco terms, policies, or guidelines at any time in our sole discretion. Any new agreement will be effective immediately, by posting a new agreement and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You agree that even if you have not personally visited the website with the new terms of this agreement, that they have full force immediately. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive any right you may have to receive additional notice of such changes.</p>
<p class="p2">Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes or modifications will confirm your acceptance of such changes or modifications. You should frequently review these Terms and all applicable terms, policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use.</p>
<p class="p2">If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Services. Any use of the Services in violation of these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your right to use the Services. You agree that your use of the Services will always be subject to the most current version of these Terms of Service at the time of such use.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>2. Limits on Your Use of the Card Services</b></p>
<p class="p2">You acknowledge that Eco or our partner banks may impose limits on your use of the Card Services. We may not allow payment from all types of funding sources and that we may otherwise limit payments, and/or payees at our discretion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You cannot use virtual cards in any way beyond their intended purpose.</p>
<p class="p2">For security and fraud protection, Eco will impose limits on the dollar amount that you can authorize in a transaction, and over a period of time. In addition to these set limits, Eco and its partner banks retain the right to impose additional limits at our discretion. The maximum amount initially allowable for authorization is $10,000 per transaction and $20,000 per calendar day. These limits are subject to increase or decrease at our discretion based on an algorithmic review process and a manual review process.</p>
<p class="p2">Your Eco Card may be used only for domestic card payments within the United States and cannot be used for: (i) international card transactions, (ii) ATM withdrawals, or (iii) to receive cashback in connection with a card payment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Additional limitations on Eco Card use may be imposed at any time at our sole discretion and without prior notice.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>3. Investigations, Account Suspensions and Termination</b></p>
<p class="p2">Eco and our partner banks reserve the right to investigate your use of the Service for compliance with this Agreement, and in order to comply with law, regulation, legal process or government request.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">We may refuse to process any transaction that we believe violates the terms of this Agreement, the Eco Terms of Service, any other agreements between you and Eco or any applicable network rule or law.</p>
<p class="p12">The Eco Card is the property of the Issuer and must be surrendered upon demand. The Card is nontransferable and it may be canceled, repossessed, or revoked at any time without prior notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p13"><br>
If we suspect you of violating any applicable Terms of Service, network rule or law, Eco or Issuer may suspend or terminate your ability to access the Services under any or all of your accounts. Eco reserves the right to determine whether or not you have access to these services.</p>
<p class="p16"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><b>4. Identity Verification</b></p>
<p class="p13"><b><br>
</b>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires us to help the Issuer obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who requests to use the Eco Card Services.</p>
<p class="p13"><br>
When you register for the Eco Card Services we will ask you for your name, address, date of birth, your Social Security number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. You authorize us and our partners to make inquiries that we consider appropriate and use third party services to help us verify your identity and determine if we should open, maintain, collect or close your account.</p>
<p class="p13"><br>
We may make additional requests for information at any time. We may require you to provide all of a taxpayer identification number, take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, provide a copy of an identifying ID card such a driver’s license or passport, and verify information you provide against third party databases or through other sources.</p>
<p class="p13"><br>
We, and our partner banks, may also report the status, history and/or closure of your account to third-party services.</p>
<p class="p13"><br>
If you do not provide this information or we cannot verify your identity, we can refuse to allow you to use the Services, or suspend or terminate your account. If you allow someone else to use your Eco Account, you are responsible and liable for all transactions, withdrawals, deposits and fees that arise out of such use.</p>
<p class="p16"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>D. Refunds, Errors and Disputes</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>1. Payment History:</b></p>
<p class="p2">When you use your Eco Card a record of the transaction will automatically recorded in the “Your Cards” section of the Eco Mobile App. You should also receive a receipt directly from the Merchant.</p>
<p class="p2">Except as required by law, you are responsible for:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li12">Compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Eco Account and your use of the Eco Card Services, and</li>
  <li class="li14">Reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Eco Account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Eco Account, you must contact us immediately.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>2. Refunds and returns</b></p>
<p class="p2">If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, the return and refund will be handled by the merchant. If the merchant credits your Card, the credit may not be immediately available. While merchant refunds post as soon as they are received, please note that we have no control over when a merchant sends a credit transaction and the refund may not be available for a number of days after the date the refund transaction occurs. Refunds will be recorded along with your transactions in the Activity section of the Eco Platform.</p>
<p class="p2">Neither the Issuer nor Eco is responsible for the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspects of the goods or services you purchase from others with the Card. If you have a problem with a purchase you made with the Card, or if you have a dispute with the merchant, you must handle it directly with the merchant</p>
<p class="p2"><b>3. Processing Errors</b></p>
<p class="p2">We will generally attempt to fix any processing errors that we discover. If the error resulted in your payment of an amount larger than what you authorize, we will transfer the difference to your linked bank account.

  <li class="li12"><b>4. Disputes</b></li>
  <li class="li14"><b><br>
</b>You agree to comply with the payment dispute resolution procedure described below for any payments made using an Eco Card. If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a merchant, please notify us as soon as possible. This is our process for resolving disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p17">A. Contact <b>support@eco.com</b><span class="s1">​ </span>directly or by tapping “dispute” on the Transaction Details screen to open a dispute case within sixty (60) days of the date of the transaction in question. Your notice must include the following information:</p>

<p class="p19">B. Respond to our requests for other information. We may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents depending on the situation. You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>

<p class="p20">D. Eco and our partner bank will make a final decision on your claim, in our sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online payment dispute resolution process or any other information Eco deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="p17">E. Eco will tell you the results within three (3) business days after completing the investigation. If Eco decides that there was no error, Eco will send you a written explanation. Copies of the documents used in the investigation may be obtained by contacting Eco at <b>support@eco.com</b>.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li12"><b>5. Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers</b></li>
  <li class="li13"><b><br>
</b>If you believe your Eco Card has been lost or stolen or you believe a transaction has been made without your permission using information from your Card, or Eco Card Account or you believe your Eco Account Credentials have been used without your permission tell us AT ONCE, and FREEZE the relevant card(s) via the “Your Cards section in the Eco Mobile Apps. Reporting your Card lost or stolen, and any unauthorized or unexpected activity to <b>support@eco.com</b><span class="s1">​ </span>as soon as possible is the best way of keeping your possible losses down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li13"></li>
  <li class="li13">We may suspend or cancel your Card and corresponding Eco Account in the event of excessive reports of Card loss or theft. You agree that any unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given authority to use the Card or PIN and that you will be liable for all such uses by such person. For example, if you have given your Card or Card information to another person to use, such as a friend or relative, you are responsible for that person’s transactions with your Card, and if you have given your Card information to a merchant for a transaction, you have given authority to that merchant to debit the Card for that transaction.</li>
  <li class="li13"><br>
If you tell us within two business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Eco Card, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Eco Card without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within two business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Eco Card, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Eco Card, without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.</li>
  <li class="li13"><br>
Also, if you become aware of and/or your periodic statement shows transactions you did not make, notify Eco at once following the procedures stated in the Section of this Agreement titled “Disputes”. If you do not notify Eco within sixty (60) days after you become aware of the transaction and/or after the statement was made available to you, you may not get back any value you lost after the sixty (60) days if Eco can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the value if you had notified Eco in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital stay) kept you from telling us, Eco may extend the time periods. If the Card has been lost or stolen, the Card will be blocked to keep losses down.</li>
  <li class="li14"><br>
You agree to cooperate reasonably with us and the Issuer in our attempts to recover funds from, and to assist in the prosecution of, any unauthorized users of your Card.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><b>6. Additional Limits on Liability Under Mastercard Rules.</b></p>
<p class="p2">Under Mastercard Rules, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using your Eco Card if you can demonstrate that you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your Card from risk of loss or theft. You must notify us within two (2) days after the electronic statement was made available to you showing unauthorized transaction(s) in order to take advantage of any such limited liability provisions.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>E. Other Terms</b></p>
