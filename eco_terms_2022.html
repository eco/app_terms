Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate, and issues that the Agreement to Arbitrate indicates that a court can resolve.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_a5qt2nue1qug-1" start="3"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Scope of Arbitration.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; You and Eco agree that all Claims will be resolved exclusively by individual (not class or classwide) binding arbitration with a single neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Eco each may: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, and (ii) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_a5qt2nue1qug-1" start="4"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">Arbitration Procedures.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_a5qt2nue1qug-2 start" start="1"><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c7">The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">AAA</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;) in accordance with the then- current Consumer Arbitration Rules, including the Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">AAA Rules</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;), as may be modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA Rules are available at </span><span class="c11 c7"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1671585097458573&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sNk72sbG43kO9i_BdIHJA">www.adr.org</a></span><span class="c4">. In the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, another administrator will be selected by the parties or by a court.</span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">The arbitrator shall be a practicing attorney or retired judge having experience with and knowledge of online commerce law and, to the extent possible, laws governing digital assets.</span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Any arbitration hearings shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually-agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $25,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted based solely on written submissions pursuant to the AAA Rules, unless you or Eco request otherwise pursuant to the AAA Rules.</span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">The arbitrator shall decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this User Agreement (including the Agreement to Arbitrate) or any other terms of use applicable to the Eco Platform are enforceable, unconscionable, or illusory, as well as any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and a judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The parties agree and acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Agreement to Arbitrate in this User Agreement.</span></li></ol><p class="c9 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_a5qt2nue1qug-1" start="5"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Costs of Arbitration</span><span class="c7">. Payment of all AAA or arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or Eco) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. If the value of the relief you seek for a Claim is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, Eco will pay as much of the AAA or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys&rsquo; fees; provided, however, that in the event the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your or Eco&rsquo;s claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then you or Eco may seek to recover from you or Eco any fees it paid, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, to the extent permitted by the AAA Rules and applicable law.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c2 lst-kix_a5qt2nue1qug-1" start="6"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, YOU AND ECO EACH AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;).
