<p class="p3"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Deposits. </b>The Eco Platform allows you to link your bank account and complete deposits of U.S. Dollars into your Account via automated clearing house (“<b>ACH</b>”) transfer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you complete a “deposit” from your bank account into your Account, you are using Third Party Services to exchange your U.S. Dollars for USDC, which will then be credited to your Account balance (a “<b>Deposit</b>”). Following a Deposit, your Account may not be credited for up to five (5) business days so that the transfer from your bank account has time to process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name on any linked bank account you use for Deposits must match the name associated with your Account.</li>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

    <li class="li2"><b>Recurring Deposits. </b>You may initiate recurring Deposits into your Account, in which case you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic transactions in accordance with your selected amount, such as recurring ACH debit entries from your linked bank account or direct deposits from your payroll provider (“<b>Recurring Deposits</b>”). As with Deposits, when you complete a Recurring Deposit into your Account, you are using Third Party Services to exchange your U.S. Dollars for USDC, which will then be credited to your Account balance. Your recurring transactions will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Eco cancels the recurring order. If you select a U.S. bank account as your payment method for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday, or after bank business hours, the ACH credit or debit will be executed on the next business day. If your bank is unable to process any electronic ACH debit entry, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of cancellation of the transaction and notify you of your options to try again or otherwise work with your bank.</li>

<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Withdrawals.</b> The Eco Platform allows you to link your bank account and complete withdrawals from your Account via ACH transfer or, in Eco’s sole discretion, through other transfer methods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you complete a “withdrawal” from your Account to your bank account, you are using Third Party Services to exchange your USDC in your Account balance for U.S. Dollars, which will then be transferred to your linked bank account (a “<b>Withdrawal</b>”).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following a Withdrawal, your Account will immediately be debited for the amount of the Withdrawal, but your bank account may not be credited for up to five (5) business days so that the transfer to your bank account has time to process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once Eco has initiated a Withdrawal following your instructions the timing of the availability in your bank account may be further delayed by your bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name on any linked bank account you use for Withdrawals must match the name associated with your Account.</li>

If your Transaction is not successful for any reason, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Eco, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the Transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Account balance or other linked accounts, in any amount equal to the Transaction amount. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your bank account or payment provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any Transaction in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the Transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we reasonably suspect that the Transaction is erroneous; or if we suspect the Transaction or your actions on the Eco Platform violate this User Agreement.</li>

The particular Outside Transactions you may engage in may be updated from time to time. When you spend your Account balance to make an Outside Transaction such as a Gift Card Transaction, Card Transaction, or Bill Pay Transaction (as defined below), you are using Third Party Services to cause the USDC in your Account balance to be debited and for an equivalent value in U.S. Dollars to be used to pay the payee of the Outside Transaction. Outside Transactions are not reversible by Eco, and if you have any issues resulting from such a Transaction or from the goods and services you purchased, you must resolve such issues directly with the applicable payee or Third Party Provider responsible for providing the Third Party Services that enable the particular Outside Transaction.</li>

    <li class="li2"><b>Complaint Process.</b> If you have a complaint or dispute with Eco (a “<b>Complaint</b>”), you agree to first contact Eco at <span class="s1">support@eco.com</span> so that we may attempt to resolve your Complaint. If we are unable to resolve your Complaint through customer support within 15 business days or, as provided below, through small claims court, your and Eco’s sole and exclusive remedy for any Complaint, dispute, controversy or claim, whether founded in contract, tort, statutory or common law, concerning or arising out of this User Agreement or your use of the Eco Platform, including the applicability, scope or validity of this Section 6 (a “<b>Claim</b>”), shall be pursuant to the binding arbitration provisions below. This Section 6 shall be referred to as the “<b>Agreement to Arbitrate</b>.”</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Nature of Arbitration. </b>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate, and issues that the Agreement to Arbitrate indicates that a court can resolve.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Scope of Arbitration.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You and Eco agree that all Claims will be resolved exclusively by individual (not class or classwide) binding arbitration with a single neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Eco each may: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, and (ii) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Arbitration Procedures.</b></li>
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li class="li2">The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the then- current Consumer Arbitration Rules, including the Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”), as may be modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA Rules are available at <span class="s1">www.adr.org</span>. In the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, another administrator will be selected by the parties or by a court.</li>
      <li class="li2">The arbitrator shall be a practicing attorney or retired judge having experience with and knowledge of online commerce law and, to the extent possible, laws governing digital assets.</li>
      <li class="li2">Any arbitration hearings shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually-agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $25,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted based solely on written submissions pursuant to the AAA Rules, unless you or Eco request otherwise pursuant to the AAA Rules.</li>
      <li class="li2">The arbitrator shall decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this User Agreement (including the Agreement to Arbitrate) or any other terms of use applicable to the Eco Platform are enforceable, unconscionable, or illusory, as well as any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and a judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The parties agree and acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Agreement to Arbitrate in this User Agreement.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Costs of Arbitration</b>. Payment of all AAA or arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or Eco) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. If the value of the relief you seek for a Claim is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, Eco will pay as much of the AAA or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees; provided, however, that in the event the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your or Eco’s claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then you or Eco may seek to recover from you or Eco any fees it paid, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by the AAA Rules and applicable law.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.</b> TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, YOU AND ECO EACH AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “<b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>”). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ECO AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS ARBITRATION. IN ADDITION, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ECO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. IF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS HELD TO BE UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL NOT APPLY TO THAT CLAIM.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Severability. </b>With the exception of the Class Action Waiver above, if any provision of this Agreement to Arbitrate is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining terms will be enforced.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li2"><b>Opt-Out Procedure.</b> You may opt out from this Agreement to Arbitrate, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any claim, by mailing Eco a written opt-out notice within thirty (30) days after you accept the User Agreement, or for existing customers to agree to the Agreement to Arbitrate as a terms update, within thirty (30) days of agreeing to such updated terms.
