<p class="p25"><span class="s1"><b>1.3 Storage of Digital Assets.</b></span></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b>Prime Trust will receive Digital Assets for storage by generating Private Keys and their Public Key pairs, with Prime Trust retaining custody of such Private Keys. “<b>Private Key</b>” means an alphanumeric string known only to the holder of a Digital Asset, which must be used to transact the Digital Asset represented by the corresponding Public Key. “<b>Public Key</b>” means an alphanumeric string on a Blockchain that indicates ownership/possession of a specific amount of a Digital Asset by a specific network participant and is visible to all participants in a Blockchain’s network. Upon receipt, Prime Trust will custody the Digital Assets in Account Holder’s name or Accounts established for the benefit of Account Holder, unless otherwise specified in an Authorized Instruction. Prime Trust will be deemed to have received a Digital Asset after the Digital Asset’s receipt has been confirmed on the relevant Blockchain or otherwise ledgered to Prime Trust’s satisfaction. “<b>Blockchain</b>” means a software operating a distributed ledger which is maintained by a network of computers, and that records all transactions in a Digital Asset in theoretically unchangeable data packages known as blocks, each of which are timestamped to reference the previous block so that the blocks are linked in a chain that evidences the entire history of transactions in the Digital Asset.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p15"><span class="s1"><b>1.4 Forks, Airdrops.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p27"><span class="s1">(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, “<b>Fork</b>” means: (i) that a Digital Asset network has been changed in a way that makes it incompatible with the unchanged version of the Digital Asset network; (ii) the changes have been widely accepted by users of the Digital Asset network; and (iii) that the two resulting Digital Asset networks have not been merged together at the time of any action to be taken by Prime Trust. A Fork may create two separate Digital Asset networks (each, a “<b>Forked Network</b>”), and may result in Prime Trust holding an identical amount of Digital Assets associated with each Forked Network.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p28"><span class="s1">(b) Should a Fork occur: (i) Prime Trust retains the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether or not to support either Forked Network; (ii) in connection with determining to support or not to support a Forked Network, Prime Trust may suspend certain operations, in whole or in part (with or without advance notice), for however long Prime Trust deems reasonably necessary, in order to take the necessary steps, as determined in its sole discretion, to perform obligations hereunder with respect to supporting or not supporting a Forked Network; (iii) Account Holder hereby agrees that Prime Trust will determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not to support such Forked Network and that Account Holder will have no right or claim against Prime Trust related to value represented by any change in the value of any Digital Asset (whether on a Forked Network or otherwise), including with respect to any period of time during which Prime Trust exercises its rights described herein with respect to Forks and Forked Networks; (iv) Prime Trust will select, in its sole discretion, at least one of the Forked Networks to support and will identify such selection in a notice; (v) with respect to a Forked Network that Prime Trust chooses not to support, it may, in its sole discretion, elect to (A) abandon or otherwise not pursue obtaining the Digital Assets from that Forked Network, or (B) deliver the Digital Assets from that Forked Network to Account Holder within a time period as determined by Prime Trust in its sole discretion, together with any credentials, keys, or other information sufficient to gain control over such Digital Assets (subject to the withholding and retention by Prime Trust of any amount reasonably necessary, as determined in Prime Trust’s sole discretion, to fairly compensate Prime Trust for the efforts expended to obtain and deliver such Digital Assets to Account Holder); (vi) with respect to Forked Networks that Prime Trust chooses to support, Account Holder may be responsible for Fees to be negotiated; and (vii) Account Holder acknowledges and agrees that Prime Trust assumes no responsibility or obligations with respect to any Forked Network and related Digital Assets that it chooses not to support.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
