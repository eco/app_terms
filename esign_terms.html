  Eco, Inc. (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, "<strong>Eco</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" and "<strong>our</strong>") may need to provide you with certain communications, notices, agreements, statements, or disclosures in writing ("<strong>Communications</strong>") regarding our Services. In order to open an Eco account, you must consent to this E-Sign Consent. If you are not willing to consent, or you subsequently withdraw your consent, you will not be able to open or maintain an account with Eco.
</p>
<p>
  This E-Sign Consent applies to any and all communications and/or disclosures that Eco is legally required to provide to you in writing in connection with your account and any related products and services ("<strong>Communications</strong>"). This E-Sign Consent Policy supplements the terms and conditions contained in the User Agreement ("<strong>User Agreement</strong>").
</p>

<p>
  <strong>ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF COMMUNICATIONS & USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Under this Consent, Eco may provide all Communications electronically by email, text message, or by making them accessible via Eco websites or applications. Communications include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>Legal and regulatory disclosures and communications associated with your account or the Services;

  <li>Notices or amendments relating to the User Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Cookie Policy, this E-Sign Consent, or any other policies or agreements;

  <li>Communications regarding any deposits, withdrawals or transactions; and

  <li>Responses to claims filed in connection with your account.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In order to use Eco's Site and/or mobile applications to access, receive and retain notices electronically, you must have the following hardware and software:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>A connection to the internet.

  <li>An internet browser (ex: Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, Safari, etc.).

  <li>A computer or mobile device and an operating system capable of supporting the above.

  <li>A printer if you wish to print and retain paper records, and electronic storage if you wish to retain records in electronic form; and

  <li>Access to the email address used to create your Eco account.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>PAPER DELIVERY OF COMMUNICATIONS</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You have the right to receive Communications in paper form. To request a paper copy of any Communication at no charge, please write to us at the address set forth below within 180 days specifying in detail the Communication you would like to receive. For the avoidance of doubt, requesting a paper copy of any Communication, in and of itself, will not be treated as withdrawal of consent to receive electronic Communications.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You may withdraw your consent to receive electronic Communications at any time, by writing to the address above. However, withdrawal of your consent to receive electronic Communications may result in termination of your access to Services. Any withdrawal of your consent will be effective after a reasonable period of time for processing your request, and Eco will confirm your withdrawal of consent and its effective date in writing (either electronically or in paper form).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>COMMUNICATIONS IN WRITING</strong>
</p>
<p>
  All electronic Communications from us to you will be considered "in writing" and shall have the same meaning and effect as a paper Communication. You should print or download for your records a copy of this E-Sign Consent and any other Communication that is important to you. You acknowledge and agree that Communications are considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted to the Eco website (www.eco.com), or within 24 hours of the time emailed to you unless Eco receives notice that the email was not delivered.
